Major Project for Applications Development - Semester 1, 2014




This repository is dedicated to the major project Iâ€™m required to complete as part of my Applications Development subject in a Bachelor of Information Technology.

The subject is based around beginning programming in Visual Basic and as such the project will be written in VB. As it stands this is my first major creation outside of the occasional textbook exercise.
